# Java10x
 Repository for the Course Java10x, I will post all codes, even if they are the most basic one, until they get more advanced.
## Content
In this repository you will find all the code that i've made during the Java10x Course, it was divided in 3 parts:
### - Easy level
### - Intermediate level
### - Advanced level
This course also had 6 challenges, and you can see my notes as comments (they are in portuguese) throughout the code.
Also, the teaching of this course was using examples using Naruto, for a quicker and easy understanding.

Overhaul it was pretty nice and I could learn a lot from this.
